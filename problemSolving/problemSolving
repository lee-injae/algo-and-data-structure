What is Algorithm?

    a process or a set of steps to accomplish a certain task

INTERVIEW!

Methods
1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns


Problem solving
-Understand the problem 
-Explore Concrete Examples
-Break it Down
-Solve/Simplify
-Look Back and Refactor


Undestand the Problem
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? 
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do you have enough information
to solve the problem? 
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem

============================================================
Example)
Write a function which takes two numers and returns their sum. 
=============================================================


1. implement addition
2. what about the inputs are extremely large integers? or floats, strings? 
3. is it a string? integer? floats? 
4. what if someone only give one input or four?
5. 


Explore Examples
1. start with simples Examples
2. Progress to more complex Examples
3. explore examples with empty inputs
4. explore examples with invalid inputs
