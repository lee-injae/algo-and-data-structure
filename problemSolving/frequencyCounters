Frequency Counters

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
This can often avoid the need for nested or O(N^2) operations with arrays / strings

An Example
    Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. 
    The function should return if every value in the array has it's correspoding 
    values squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be same.
