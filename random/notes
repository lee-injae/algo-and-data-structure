I plan on making a larger post about this later but I revised the common STAR method for answering interview questions. STAR (situation task action result) over indexes on the context without zooming in on the impact. Therefore, I came up with the SAIL framework instead (situation action impact learnings) to more closely align with what interviewers are looking for when they ask questions.
Situational context (briefly). No one needs to know the inner workings of your previous employers. They need to know that your actions there translate to good work here if they hire you.
Action you took. Don’t claim ownership over a team effort nor let your ownership get diluted by incorrectly using “we” on things that you specifically did.
Impact of your actions, ideally in measured form but qualitative results work too. How do you know that what you did was worth anyone’s time and how do you know that it was the right action to take?
Learnings regardless of whether it was the right action or not, but especially if the outcome wasn’t what you expected. Employ a growth mindset and demonstrate reflection and intentionality about your work.
